  ### MysteryNum
  #### Description & Features
The user selects a maximum number to set the difficulty level, and the program randomly generates a number within that range. The player attempts to guess the correct number while tracking performance metrics like wins, losses, and consecutive wins.

Key features of the game include:
- **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: Users can change the difficulty at any time by entering a non-numeric value, which updates the maximum number for guessing.
- **Performance Tracking**: Displays total wins, losses, and consecutive wins throughout the game.
- **Robust Input Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid inputs, prompting the user to enter valid data without causing the game to crash.

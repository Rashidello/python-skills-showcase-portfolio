  ## Description
  This is a command-line number guessing game where the user selects a maximum number to set the difficulty level. The program then randomly generates a number within this range, and the user attempts to guess it.
  
  ## Features
  - **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: Users can change the difficulty at any time by entering a non-numeric value.
  - **Performance Tracking**: Displays total wins, losses, and consecutive wins throughout the game.
  - **Robust Input Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid inputs without crashing, prompting the user to enter valid data.
